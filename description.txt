Structured3D is a large-scale photo-realistic dataset with rich 3D structure annotations for a wide spectrum of structured 3D modeling tasks. We take advantage of the availability of millions of professional interior designs and automatically extract 3D structures from them. We generate high-quality images with an industry-leading rendering engine.
